Java OOP Cheatsheet (Text-Focused)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm centered around the concept of objects, which
bundle data and behavior together. Java is a fully OOP language (except for primitive types) and
strongly encourages developers to think in terms of real-world objects. The four main principles —
Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism — provide the foundation for designing
reusable, modular, and scalable software systems. This cheatsheet emphasizes conceptual
understanding with simple examples and minimal code.

1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation means restricting direct access to an object's data and only allowing controlled
interaction through methods. It mirrors real-world scenarios — for example, when you use an ATM,
you don’t directly access the bank’s database. Instead, you go through a secure interface. Similarly,
in Java, fields are often declared private, and access is given via getters and setters. This
prevents misuse and protects integrity.
Example (Conceptual): A car hides its engine details from the driver. You only interact with the car
using the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes. Internally, the engine and other systems are
encapsulated.

2. Abstraction
Abstraction is about hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the relevant aspects of an
object. It helps simplify complex systems. In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes
and interfaces. The goal is to let users focus on *what* an object does, rather than *how* it does it.
Example (Conceptual): Think of a TV remote. You only know which buttons to press to change
channels or adjust volume. You don’t know the internal circuit design, and you don’t need to. That
hidden complexity is abstraction in action.

3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to derive from another, reusing its properties and behaviors. It
represents an 'is-a' relationship. For example, a Dog is an Animal, and therefore inherits traits of an
Animal while adding its own. In Java, inheritance is implemented with the `extends` keyword. It
encourages code reuse and logical hierarchy, but should not be overused as it can create tight
coupling.
Example (Conceptual): A smartphone is a type of phone, but with extra features such as apps and
internet. The base class ‘Phone’ provides calling functionality, and ‘Smartphone’ extends it with new
abilities.

4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows a single interface to be used for different types of objects. It means ‘many
forms’. In Java, this is primarily achieved through method overriding and method overloading. It
lets objects respond differently to the same message (method call), depending on their type.
Example (Conceptual): The word ‘drive’ means different things depending on context. A human
drives a car differently than how software might ‘drive’ a robot. The action is the same, but theunderlying implementation varies.

Quick Comparison of OOP Principles- Encapsulation: Protects internal state; provides controlled access (like an ATM).

- Abstraction: Hides implementation details; shows only essential features (like a TV remote).
- Inheritance: Enables reusability by creating parent-child relationships (like Phone →
Smartphone).
- Polymorphism: Allows objects to take multiple forms; same action but different behaviors (like
‘drive’).
Together, these four principles make Java applications cleaner, easier to maintain, and closer to
how humans naturally think about real-world problems. Mastering them allows developers to build
flexible and scalable systems.
