🛠️ How to Use git branch in Practice

🔹 1. Create a New Branch  
Command:  
git checkout -b feature/some-task-name  

What it does:  
- Creates a new branch called "feature/some-task-name"  
- Switches you to that branch immediately  

Tip:  
Use naming conventions like:  
- feature/ for new features  
- bugfix/ for bug fixes  
- hotfix/ for urgent patches  

🔹 2. Work on Your Task  
Make your changes, then stage and commit them:  
git add .  
git commit -m "Add initial version of feature X"  

🔹 3. Push Your Branch to GitLab  
git push -u origin feature/some-task-name  

Explanation:  
The "-u" flag tells Git to track the remote branch, so future pushes can just use "git push".  

🔹 4. Open a Merge Request (Pull Request in GitHub terms)  
In GitLab:  
- Go to the "Merge Requests" section  
- Click "New Merge Request"  
- Choose your source branch (e.g., feature/some-task-name)  
- Choose the target branch (usually main)  
- Add a title and description  
- Assign reviewers if needed  

🔹 5. After the Merge (Optional Cleanup)  
Once your code is merged:  
git checkout main  
git pull origin main  
git branch -d feature/some-task-name    (deletes local branch)  
git push origin --delete feature/some-task-name    (deletes remote branch)  

👥 Group Activity Suggestion for Kickoff  
- Each team member clones the repo  
- Creates and pushes their own branch (e.g., feature/hello-name)  
- Opens a test Merge Request with a small edit (e.g., adding their name to a contributors file)
