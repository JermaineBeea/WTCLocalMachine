ADJUST BRIGHTNESS

It looks like you're using Pop!_OS, which is a Linux-based operating system, and not macOS. The osascript command and the brightness utility are both macOS-specific tools and won't work on Pop!_OS or any Linux distribution.

To change the screen brightness on Pop!_OS using bash, here are some Linux-based alternatives:

1. Using xrandr
You can use the xrandr command to adjust brightness settings on most Linux systems, including Pop!_OS.
Steps:

Open a terminal and run the following command to list the displays:

bash
xrandr --verbose

Identify the display name (it might be something like eDP-1, HDMI-1, etc.).
To set the brightness (e.g., to 50%):

bash
xrandr --output DP-3 --brightness 0.5
xrandr --output 

Replace DP-3 with your display's name and 0.5 with your desired brightness level (where 1.0 is maximum brightness).
